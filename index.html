                Wangari Maathai(1940-2011) had a lot of firsts in her lifetime. She was the first African woman to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. 
                As well as, also being the first female scholar from East Africa to complete a doctorate in Biology 
                and the first female professor EVER in Kenya. Maathai was not only an academic, but also 
                played a very active part in Kenyas' struggle for democracy. She was part fo the opposition to the <a

                <br>
                <br>
                In 1977 she started a grass-roots movement aimed at countering the deforestation 
                that was threatening the means of subsistence of the agricultural population. 
                The campaign encouraged women to plant trees in their local environments and to think ecologically. 
                The so-called Green Belt Movement spread to other African countries, and contributed to the planting of over thirty million trees.
                <br>
                <br>
                Maathai's mobilisation of African women was not limited in its vision to work for sustainable development; 
                she saw tree-planting in a broader perspective which included democracy, women's rights, and international solidarity. 
                In the words of the Nobel Committee: “She thinks globally and acts locally.”

            <h3 id="headline"> Major Achievements </h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>1971 - Obtains a Doctorate in Biology</strong>: Mathaai persued her doctoral studies in Germany and at the University of Nairobi, obtaining a Ph.D. (1971) from the University of Nairobi,
           where she also taught veterinary anatomy. Later she became chair of the Department of Veterinary Anatomy and an associate professor. 
           In both cases, she was the first Kenyan woman to attain those positions. 
          </li>
          <br>
          <li>
<strong>1972-1977 Start of Activism </strong>: During this time, she also campaigned for equal benefits for the female staff working at the university, 
            going so far as trying to turn the academic staff association of the university into a union, so that they could better negotiate benefits. 
            She was a member of many different charities and volunteeer associations, some of them being; The Nairobi branch of the Kenya Red Cross Society, 
            The Kenya Association of University Women, The Environment Liaison Centre, The National Council of Women of Kenya (NCWK) and The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP).
            Her work at these various volunteer associations, helped Maathai come to the conclusion that the root of most of Kenya's problems was environmental degradation.

          <li>
          <strong>1977- The Green Belt Movement </strong>:Professor Wangari Maathai founded The Green Belt Movement (GBM) under the National Council of Women in Kenya; 
          she launched it to reposnd to the needs of Women in rural Kenya, whose livelihoods were suffering due to environmental degradation.
          GBM is an environmental organization that empowers communities, particularly women, to conserve the environment and improve livelihoods. 
          These communities reported that their streams were drying up, their food supply was less secure, and they had to walk further and further to get firewood for fuel and fencing.
          GBM encouraged the women to work together to grow seedlings and plant trees to bind the soil, store rainwater, provide food and firewood, and receive a small monetary token for their work. 
          GBM is still active until this day, where they continue to support communities through tree planting and water harvesting, 
          a wide range of mainstream advocacy related to environmental conservation, fighting gender inequality and campaigning for policies related to climate change.
